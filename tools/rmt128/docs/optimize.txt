Player speed/size optimizations
-------------------------------

Are you an Atari coder? Yes, then you can read below...

If you will export song as "RMT stripped song file (*.rmt)", you can specify
address for required memory location of this exported RMT module (RMT file
is standard Atari binary file with set of heading data). You can take also 
a RMT FEATures definitions text and move it into rmt_feat.a65 source
code file by clipboard. (You have to replace a part between the "--BEGIN--"
and the "--END--" marks.)

If you do it and compile such modified player source, you obtain optimized
player routine for this concrete RMT module.

Optimized player routine contains only features used by this RMT module,
that's why it is more or less smaller and quicker. Of course, you can't 
use it with any other RMT module and every time you change the RMT module,
it's very recommended to take RMT FEATures definitions text again
and recompile RMT player routine.

This technique is very useful for background music in your demos, games, etc.

Example:
You can see the example of this method in "asm_src/optim" directory.
Optimized player for "music.rmt" module only is smaller about 832 bytes (!)
and surely much faster than standard full-features providing player.
